# Bachelor_Project

The project is the code that was used for building a simulation of a real-life production and used for training a reinforcement learning agent. 

THe code runs by running the (updated) main-function which calls compiles the simulation from model.py and creates an instance of the learning agent from agents.py
and trains the agent instance in some time period. 

The learning agent from agents.py uses a neural network state approximator which is a PyTorch linear neural network instance from DeepQNetwork.py.
